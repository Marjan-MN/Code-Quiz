# Code-Quiz
## Description
A code quiz built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers an interactive and engaging experience for users who want to test their coding knowledge. The quiz incorporates a timer to add a sense of urgency and challenge. Users are presented with a series of coding-related questions and multiple-choice answers. After completing the quiz, the project automatically grades the user's performance based on the number of correct answers. This feedback allows users to evaluate their coding skills and identify areas for improvement. Overall, the code quiz project combines technical expertise with a user-friendly interface to create an enjoyable and educational experience.

Through this project, I had the opportunity to learn and enhance various skills. Firstly, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deepening my understanding of these web development languages. I became proficient in utilizing HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and functionality to the quiz. Moreover, I learned how to implement a timer feature, which required me to work with JavaScript's timing functions and manipulate DOM elements. Additionally, I gained insights into the importance of user experience and interface design, as I aimed to create an engaging and intuitive quiz for participants. Lastly, by developing a grading system.
